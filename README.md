# Trying fun projects in frontend masters

### Each branch name represents a project

type of branch names should be :

- fix - when a feature is fixed

- feature - adding different features

- refactor - changing components

- style - any style change

working branches should start with name of the project followed by subject type
then relevant changes to the project
example:

    multiStepForm/fix/list update on change
